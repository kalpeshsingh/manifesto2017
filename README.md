# Manifesto 2017
**Welcome to my personal goals list for 2017.**

I've started writing about [my goals in 2016](https://goal2016.knowkalpesh.in/)  which was inspired from [Una Kravets](@Una). This year, I've thought a bit different and asked my buddies who know me more than a year to challenge me. These fellas came up with some inspiring and weird challenges.

Each card reflects their personality and challenges to me. I'll work hard to complete them. Though in 2016, I couldn't complete every goal but it was fun and inspiring. 

With making my Manifesto 2017 on GitHub, I invite you to throw your three weird, funny challenges that you think can fill my 2017 with excitement and memorable.

I'm excited to hear back from you here as PR or [@knowkalpesh](@knowkalpesh)
